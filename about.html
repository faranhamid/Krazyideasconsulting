                            At 28, Faran Hamid has already built what most consultants spend decades chasing—a 7-figure consulting empire that spans 10+ countries and delivers results that redefine entire industries.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Faran's journey to consulting dominance wasn't conventional. While pursuing Cybersecurity at UTSA, he recognized that the real battlefield wasn't in protecting systems—it was in building them to dominate markets. So he made the boldest move of his career: he dropped out to bet on himself. That decision turned into KrazyIdeasConsulting, a boutique firm that doesn't just advise—it executes with surgical precision.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            What sets Faran apart isn't just his track record of generating $47+ million in client revenue—it's his ability to see opportunities where others see obstacles. From the boardrooms of Toronto to the innovation hubs of Silicon Valley, from the financial districts of London to the emerging markets of Southeast Asia, Faran has helped founders and executives in over 10 countries transform their businesses from stagnant to unstoppable. His approach combines the analytical rigor of his cybersecurity background with the street-smart instincts of someone who's built something from nothing.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Today, Faran operates from his base in Houston, Texas—but his influence spans continents. He's the consultant that other consultants call when they're out of their depth. Whether it's a DTC brand stuck at $2M looking to break through to 8 figures, a SaaS startup preparing for their Series A, or an established company ready to obliterate their competition, Faran brings the same relentless focus: identify the leverage points, design the strategy, deploy with precision, and dominate the outcome.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            His philosophy is simple yet revolutionary: most people play not to lose, but winners play to rewrite the rules of the game entirely. When you're willing to bet everything on your vision, the market has no choice but to respond. That's the Faran Hamid difference—and it's why clients across the globe trust him with their most ambitious growth objectives.

                        <p>Growing up in Toronto, Ontario, Faran learned early that playing it safe was the fastest way to mediocrity. While his peers followed traditional paths, he was already thinking differently—questioning systems, finding inefficiencies, and imagining better ways to win.</p>
